# Guaraci: 
Guaraci is an undergraduate research project with the goal of developing an Unified Database of Epidemiologic and Genomic Data pertaining to Neglected Tropical Diseases. It obtained 1st place for a PIBITI scholarship on ICMC.

The focus of the current stage of development pertains to epidemiologic data of the respective conditions in Brazil, extracting the data specially from [Datasus - Tabnet](https://datasus.saude.gov.br/informacoes-de-saude-tabnet/), organizing it as a database, and — as the final step of this stage — developing a back and front-end so that others may easily access this data online.

PROGRESS:
 - **\[Complete\]** Data Extraction from Datasus
 - **\[Complete\]** Treatment of the Data ( [dbc2csv](https://github.com/greatjapa/dbc2csv) was used in the conversion of Datasus unique data type into csv )
 - **\[Complete\]** Deployment of a SQLite Database

\
CURRENT TASK:
- Back-end Planning and Implementation

\
\
Once this starting stage is finished and resources are obtained the project will move forward to the extraction of genomic data.
